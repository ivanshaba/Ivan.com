bioLong: |
      As a programmer and digital manager, my work sits at the intersection of technology and growth. I build and manage digital systems that not only function efficiently but also drive visibility, engagement, and business results. My journey has been largely self-driven, shaped by hands-on experience in software development, web technologies, and modern deployment workflows.
      Beyond writing code, I specialize in leveraging digital marketing strategies—social media, web optimization, and online branding—to translate technical solutions into real-world impact. I thrive on innovative thinking, problem-solving, and adapting technology to meet business goals. This blend of programming expertise and digital marketing insight allows me to approach projects holistically, ensuring both technical excellence and strong market presence.
